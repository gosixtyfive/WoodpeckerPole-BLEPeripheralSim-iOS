# WoodpeckerPole-BLEPeripheralSim-iOS

This iOS iPad app has been developed to support the "Possibly the world's tallest Woodpecker Pole toy" exhibit for the 2017 Austin Maker Faire.

It is a iOS app used to simulate the embedded Arduino system that controls the Robot used to lift the robot.  It was used in developing and debugging the API between the iOS remote control and the Robot.
